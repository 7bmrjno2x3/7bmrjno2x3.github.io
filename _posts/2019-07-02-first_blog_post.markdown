The  first step is always the most difficult.   I really enjoy learning about programming and wanted to experience this new world. It's been so much learning in a very short amount of time.  Whenever I have difficulties with the lessons or get stuck with a lab, I know that there is a community of people who are a stone's throw away. I can reach out to them for some support and ask questions that may illuminate the issues and provide a path forward.
